## Project description
I created this repository to learn how to apply Keras to future projects and 
generally dive a little deeper into Deep Learning and neural networks. The 
repository contains a notebook that specifically explains the high-level API of 
TensorFlow, called Keras. It also explains the basic principles of neural 
networks so you understand what's behind the code and what's happening. Finally, 
we create a two-layer neural network from Scratch, which is then trained with 
synthetic data and can thus already make initial predictions. This should be an 
important building block for future Deep Learning projects.
